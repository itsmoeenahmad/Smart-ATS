**Before You Use the Code**

Take a moment to read through the code instead of just copy-pasting it. I have added comments to explain each part so you can understand what is happening step by step.

If anything is unclear or you are stuck, feel free to reach out - you can DM me on Instagram or LinkedIn. I am happy to help!
